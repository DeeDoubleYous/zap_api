# zap_api

The api for accessing the zap store of found pangolin data. 

>Pangolins are the worldâ€™s most trafficked mammal and are threatened solely by human
impacts. In addition to tracking and poaching, many pangolins in Africa face the risk of being
killed on roads and by electric fences.

## Running the zap_api yourself
After cloning the repository, you'll need to run `npm install` then you can build the app with `webpack`. You'll find the app file in dist as app.js. For the app to run propeliy you'll need to provide a credentials.json file which will look like this 
```
{
  "host": DATABASE_HOST
  "user": DATABASE_USER_USERNAME
  "password": DATABASE_USER_PASSWORD
  "database": DATABASE_NAME
}
```
Your database will have two tables with this design
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7958479/145321135-5f5b82e6-eabb-400f-883e-6154b6fd4854.png)

with the deathTypes table populated with the desired deathtypes.
You won't be able to run this against the exising database as the images are stored locally to the server app and adding new records which point only to local files will cause issue.
